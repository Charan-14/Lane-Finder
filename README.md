# **Road Lane Line Detection** 

A crucial task for Self-Driving Car Assitance. 

# Overview

In this project using Computer Vision fundamentals we develop a pipeline to detect Road lane lines for Autonomous Cars Assitance. Both Ipython Notebook [Lane Finder Notebook](https://github.com/Charan-14/Lane-Finder/blob/master/Lane_finder.ipynb) and a python file [Lane Finder Python Code]() is provided in the repo. Along with a detail markdown file explaining the pipeline. The outputs for images and videos are stored as well, which were provided as a challenge by Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nano Degree program.
